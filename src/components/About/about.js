My name is Joel and I am a **passionate** web developer based in New York City. I am a graduate of the Flatiron School in NYC with over two-years of experience in Object-Oriented programming, Ruby on Rails and Javascript. I have a knack for learning new technologies and enjoy adapting to the shifts in the industry. My philosphy: always be learning and always be coding.

I welcome you to reach out to me if you are a developer looking to collaborate or if you would like to hire me for a project. I encourage you to email me or contact me through one of the social media links at the bottom of this page.
